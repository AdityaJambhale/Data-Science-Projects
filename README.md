Decision Tree Project - Price Prediction of Used Cars

Overview
This project is a used car price prediction model built using a Decision Tree Regressor. The goal is to predict the selling price of a used car based on various features like brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more. The dataset used contains real-world car sales data.

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas (for data preprocessing)
NumPy
Scikit-Learn (for model building and evaluation)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
Jupyter Notebook

Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple features that influence the price of a used car, such as:
Year (Manufacturing year)
Brand & Model
Mileage (in km or miles)
Fuel Type (Petrol, Diesel, Electric, etc.)
Transmission Type (Manual/Automatic)
Owner Type (First-hand, Second-hand, etc.)

Selling Price (Target variable)

📊 Model Performance

Algorithm Used: Decision Tree Regressor
Evaluation Metric: R² Score (Accuracy)
Model Accuracy: 62%

Improvements Possible:
Feature Engineering (Extracting more meaningful features)
Hyperparameter Tuning (Optimizing tree depth, min_samples_split, etc.)
Trying Ensemble Methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
